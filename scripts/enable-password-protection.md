# Enable Supabase Auth Security Features

## Leaked Password Protection

**Status**: ⚠️ DISABLED - Needs to be enabled in Supabase Dashboard

### How to Enable:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to: **Authentication** → **Settings** → **Auth Configuration**
3. Find **"Leaked Password Protection"** section
4. Toggle **"Enable leaked password protection"** to ON
5. This will check user passwords against HaveIBeenPwned database

### Benefits:

- Prevents users from using passwords that have been compromised in data breaches
- Enhances overall platform security
- Meets security best practices for user account protection

### Implementation:

```javascript
// The auth service already handles password validation
// Once enabled in dashboard, Supabase will automatically reject compromised passwords
// during signup and password updates
```

## Additional Security Enhancements Applied:

### 1. Password Strength Requirements

- Minimum 8 characters (implemented in Zod schema)
- Email validation
- Username validation with regex

### 2. Session Security

- JWT tokens with proper expiration
- Secure session storage
- Automatic token refresh

### 3. Route Protection

- Middleware-based authentication checks
- Protected routes configuration
- Proper redirects for unauthenticated users

## Next Steps:

1. ✅ Enable leaked password protection in Supabase Dashboard
2. Consider adding password complexity requirements (uppercase, numbers, special chars)
3. Implement account lockout after failed attempts
4. Add two-factor authentication support
