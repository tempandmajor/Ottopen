## ‚úÖ All MVP Features Implemented Successfully!

### üéØ **What Was Built**

#### 1. **Working Like/Unlike Functionality** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

**Implementation:**

- Integrated `useAuth` hook to get current user
- Connected to existing `dbService.toggleLike()` method
- Real-time UI updates when liking/unliking works
- Like count updates dynamically
- Loading liked posts status on page load using `getUserLikedPosts()`
- Toast notifications for success/error states
- "Sign in required" message for unauthenticated users
- Interactive heart icon with fill state when liked

**Files Modified:**

- `app/works/page.tsx` - Added like state management and handler

**Code Highlights:**

```typescript
const handleLike = async (postId: string, e?: React.MouseEvent) => {
  e?.stopPropagation()

  if (!user) {
    toast.error('Please sign in to like works')
    return
  }

  const userId = user.profile?.id || user.id
  const isLiked = likedPostIds.has(postId)

  await dbService.toggleLike(postId, userId)

  setLikedPostIds(prev => {
    const next = new Set(prev)
    if (isLiked) {
      next.delete(postId)
      toast.success('Like removed')
    } else {
      next.add(postId)
      toast.success('Work liked!')
    }
    return next
  })

  // Update likes count in posts and search results
  setPosts(prev =>
    prev.map(post =>
      post.id === postId
        ? { ...post, likes_count: (post.likes_count || 0) + (isLiked ? -1 : 1) }
        : post
    )
  )
}
```

  <DialogContent className="max-w-3xl max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto">
    {/* Work preview with stats, badges, author info, actions */}
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>

  className="cursor-pointer"
  onClick={() => setQuickViewPost(post)}
>

  if (!user) {
    toast.error('Please sign in to follow authors')
    return
  }

  const userId = user.profile?.id || user.id
  const isFollowing = followingIds.has(authorId)

  await dbService.toggleFollow(userId, authorId)

  setFollowingIds(prev => {
    const next = new Set(prev)
    if (isFollowing) {
      next.delete(authorId)
      toast.success('Unfollowed successfully')
    } else {

  const now = new Date()
  const diffTime = Math.abs(now.getTime() - created.getTime())
  const diffDays = Math.ceil(diffTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24))
  return diffDays <= 7
}

// Badge display
{isNewWork(post.created_at) && (
  <Badge
    variant="outline"
    className="bg-green-500/10 text-green-600 border-green-500/20 flex-shrink-0"
