## 📊 Example Calculations

### Per Word (Most Common):

```
50,000 word book × $0.30/word = $15,000
60,000 word book × $0.50/word = $30,000
70,000 word book × $1.00/word = $70,000
```

### Per Page:

```
200 pages × $125/page = $25,000
(Auto-converts: 200 pages ≈ 55,000 words)
```

### Per Project:

```
Fixed rate: $45,000
(Includes research, writing, 2 revisions)
```

### Hourly:

```
150 hours × $65/hour = $9,750
```
