### 3. Integration

**File**: `app/profile/[username]/page.tsx`

- Simplified to use EnhancedProfileView component
- Clean integration pattern

## Technical Details

### Data Flow

1. Profile loads → Fetches user data from database
2. Reviews tab clicked → API call to `/api/reviews/user/[userId]`
3. Review data processed → Calculate average rating and stats
4. Display → Show reviews with rating breakdown

### Fields Used from User Type

- ✅ `id`, `email`, `display_name`, `username`
- ✅ `bio`, `specialty`, `avatar_url`
- ✅ `location`, `website_url`, `twitter_handle`, `linkedin_url`
- ✅ `stripe_connect_account_id`, `stripe_connect_onboarded`
- ✅ `account_type`, `verification_status`
- ✅ `preferred_genres[]`

### Fields NOT Available (Removed from Implementation)

- ❌ `pricing_model`, `rate_per_word`, `rate_per_page`, `rate_hourly`
- ❌ `project_rate_min`, `project_rate_max`
- ❌ `experience_level`, `specializations[]`
- ❌ `rating`, `total_reviews`, `jobs_completed`
- ❌ `portfolio_url`, `writer_bio`
- ❌ `turnaround_time_days`

**Note**: These fields exist in database schema but not in the TypeScript User type. To add them, update `/src/lib/supabase.ts`.

## Build Status

✅ **Build**: Successful
✅ **TypeCheck**: Passed
✅ **Lint**: Passed

**Warnings** (expected, non-blocking):

- Prisma/OpenTelemetry critical dependency warnings
- ejs require.extensions not supported
- Edge runtime disables static generation

## Usage

2. See professional info card with rating and CTAs
3. View reviews in dedicated tab
4. Share profile via share button
5. Link to portfolio via website URL

### For Profile Owners

1. View own profile with create post functionality
2. Manage posts, likes, reshares in tabs
3. Portfolio tab shows website link if configured
4. Can add social links in settings

## Next Steps (Optional)

### To Fully Enable Professional Features:

1. **Add Missing Fields to User Type** (`/src/lib/supabase.ts`):

   ```typescript
   export interface User {
     // ... existing fields
     pricing_model?: 'per_word' | 'per_page' | 'per_project' | 'hourly'
     rate_per_word?: number
     rate_per_page?: number
     rate_hourly?: number
     project_rate_min?: number
     project_rate_max?: number
     experience_level?: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'professional' | 'expert'
     specializations?: string[]
     portfolio_url?: string
     writer_bio?: string
     turnaround_time_days?: number
   }
   ```

2. **Uncomment Pricing Display** in EnhancedProfileView.tsx (line 385-386)

3. **Add Writer Onboarding Flow** to collect:
   - Pricing preferences
   - Experience level
   - Specializations
   - Portfolio URL
   - Professional bio
   - Turnaround time

### Additional Features:

- Add ability to write reviews (currently read-only)

- Add earnings dashboard
- Add availability calendar
- Add response time tracking
- Add success rate metrics
