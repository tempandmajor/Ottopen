## Works Page Improvements ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO

### **Recommended UI Redesign:**

**New Visual Identity (Suggested):**

- Amber/orange gradient theme (content-focused)
- Magazine/library aesthetic
- Grid layout with book covers
- Orange-themed tabs and buttons
- Background: `bg-gradient-to-br from-amber-50 via-background to-orange-50`

**Suggested Tab Categories:**

1. **Featured** üìö - Curated/staff picks
2. **Trending** üî• - Uses calculate_trending_score()
3. **Popular** ‚≠ê - Sorted by likes (different from trending!)
4. **New Releases** üÜï - Posted in last 30 days

### **Working Filters Needed:**

**Genre Filter:**

- Literary Fiction
- Mystery & Thriller
- Romance
- Science Fiction
- Fantasy
- Horror
- Poetry
- Non-Fiction
- etc.

**Content Type Filter:**

- Screenplay
- Stage Play
- Book
- Short Story
- Poetry
- Article
- Essay

**Advanced Filters:**

- Reading time range (e.g., "5-10 min", "10-30 min", "30+ min")
- Completion status (Complete, WIP, Hiatus)
- Date range
- Minimum rating/likes

### **Fix Needed:**

Currently in Works page:

```typescript
// ‚ùå BROKEN: Popular and Trending are identical
const popular = [...filteredPosts]
  .sort((a, b) => (b.likes_count || 0) - (a.likes_count || 0))
  .slice(0, 4)

const trending = [...filteredPosts]
  .sort((a, b) => (b.likes_count || 0) - (a.likes_count || 0)) // Same!
  .slice(0, 4)
```

Should be:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ FIXED: Use trending_score from view
const trending = await dbService.getTrendingPosts(20)

const popular = [...filteredPosts]
  .sort((a, b) => (b.likes_count || 0) - (a.likes_count || 0))
  .slice(0, 20)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Works page redesign** with amber/orange theme
2. **Implement genre and content type filtering** on Works page
3. **Add getTrendingPosts() method** to database service
4. **Test all filtering** functionality end-to-end
5. **Add reading time estimates** to existing posts
6. **Deploy migration** to production
7. **Monitor trending algorithm** performance

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Trending algorithm needs tuning** - May need adjustment based on real usage
2. **No server-side filtering** - All filtering happens client-side (limited to loaded data)
3. **N+1 query problem** - Loading author stats in loop (should batch)
4. **No caching** - Trending scores recalculated on every query
5. **Reading time is estimate** - Based on character count, not actual content analysis

---

## Performance Considerations

**Current:**

- Authors page: Loads 20 authors, then N queries for stats (N+1 problem)
- Works page: Similar issue

**Recommended:**

- Create database views that include stats
- Use single JOIN query instead of Promise.all loop
- Add Redis caching for trending scores
- Implement pagination properly with cursor-based approach

---

## Migration Notes

**Running the migration:**

```bash
# Apply migration to Supabase
# Migration file: supabase/migrations/20250110000003_enhance_authors_and_works.sql
```

**Post-migration:**

- Existing posts will have `content_type = 'article'` by default
- Existing posts will have `completion_status = 'complete'` by default
- Reading time will be auto-calculated based on content length
- User activity stats will be calculated on first run

**Manual steps needed:**

1. Run `SELECT update_user_activity_stats();` after migration
2. Categorize existing posts with proper genres
3. Set correct content_type for existing works
4. Update reading times if needed
