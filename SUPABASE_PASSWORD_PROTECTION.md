## What is Leaked Password Protection?

Supabase can automatically check passwords against the HaveIBeenPwned.org database to prevent users from using compromised passwords. This feature is currently **disabled** and should be enabled for production.

---

## Current Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **DISABLED** - Users can currently use compromised passwords

---

## How to Enable

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/gbugafddunddrvkvgifl
2. Navigate to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Policies** (or **Auth** ‚Üí **Password Protection**)

### Step 2: Enable Password Protection

1. Find the **"Leaked Password Protection"** section
2. Toggle the switch to **ON** / **Enabled**
3. Save changes

---

## What This Does

### For New Sign-ups:

- ‚úÖ Automatically checks password against HaveIBeenPwned.org
- ‚úÖ Rejects passwords found in data breaches
- ‚úÖ Prompts user to choose a different password

### For Existing Users:

- ‚úÖ Checks password on next login/password change
- ‚úÖ Prompts password update if compromised
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Does NOT force immediate password resets (non-disruptive)

### What Gets Checked:

- ‚úÖ Common passwords (e.g., "password123")
- ‚úÖ Passwords from known data breaches
- ‚úÖ Dictionary words and simple patterns

---

## Privacy & Security

### How It Works:

1. Password is hashed locally using SHA-1
2. Only first 5 characters of hash are sent to HaveIBeenPwned API
3. API returns all hashes starting with those 5 chars
4. Full match is checked locally
5. **Your actual password never leaves the server**

### Privacy Guarantee:

- ‚úÖ k-Anonymity model (industry standard)
- ‚úÖ Password never transmitted
- ‚úÖ GDPR compliant
- ‚úÖ No user data shared with third parties

## User Experience Impact

### What Users Will See:

#### During Sign-up:

```
‚ùå This password has appeared in data breaches
   Please choose a different password
```

#### During Password Reset:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Your current password has been found in data breaches
   Please choose a new, secure password
```

### UX Best Practices:

- ‚úÖ Clear error message
- ‚úÖ Suggests strong password
- ‚úÖ No account lockout (security without friction)

---

## Alternative Configuration (Optional)

If you want more control, you can also configure:

### Minimum Password Length:

- Current: 6 characters (default)
- Recommended: 8-12 characters
- Location: Auth Settings ‚Üí Password Requirements

### Password Strength Requirements:

- Require uppercase letters
- Require lowercase letters
- Require numbers
- Require special characters

---

## Verification Steps

After enabling, test with a known compromised password:

### Test Case:

1. Try signing up with password: `password123`
2. **Expected Result:** Error message about compromised password
3. Try a strong password: `MyS3cure!Pass2025`
4. **Expected Result:** Account created successfully

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to disable this feature:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Password Protection
2. Toggle switch to **OFF** / **Disabled**
3. Save changes

**Note:** We do NOT recommend disabling this feature in production.
