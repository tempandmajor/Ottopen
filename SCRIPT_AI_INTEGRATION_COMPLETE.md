## Build Fixes Applied

### 1. **Import Path Corrections**

Fixed incorrect import paths in AI components:

- Changed `@/components/ui/*` → `@/src/components/ui/*`
- Applied to: DialogueEnhancementModal, ScriptAIAssistantPanel, ScriptResearchPanel
- Also fixed: KeyboardShortcutsModal, SearchDialog

### 2. **Script Type Issues**

- Removed non-existent `setting` and `time_period` properties from Script interface
- Used empty strings as fallbacks for scriptContext

### 3. **Type Safety Fixes**

- Fixed `selectedElement` null vs undefined mismatch
- Removed `character_name` property (doesn't exist on ScriptElement)
- Used `character_id` to find character from characters array

### 4. **Component Props Alignment**

- Updated DialogueEnhancementModal props to match usage
- Changed `onApplySuggestion` → `onApply`
- Removed `isOpen` prop (controlled by parent)
- Fixed `useEffect` hook (was using `useState`)

### 5. **Perplexity Client Fix**

## Technical Architecture

### Panel Management:

```typescript
// State
const [sidePanel, setSidePanel] = useState<'none' | 'ai' | 'research'>('none')

// Toggle AI Panel
setSidePanel(prev => prev === 'ai' ? 'none' : 'ai')

// Toggle Research Panel
setSidePanel(prev => prev === 'research' ? 'none' : 'research')

// Only one panel can be open at a time
{sidePanel === 'ai' && <ScriptAIAssistantPanel ... />}
{sidePanel === 'research' && <ScriptResearchPanel ... />}
```

### Context Building:

```typescript
const scriptContext = {
  scriptType: script.script_type, // 'screenplay' | 'teleplay' | 'stage_play'
  genre: script.genre || [], // ['thriller', 'mystery']
  logline: script.logline || '', // One-line summary
  setting: '', // Physical setting (future: add to DB)
  timePeriod: '', // Time period (future: add to DB)
}
```

### Character Context:

```typescript
// Characters fetched from API
const characters = await fetch(`/api/scripts/${scriptId}/characters`)

// Passed to AI components
characters.map(c => ({
  name: c.name,
  description: c.description,
}))

// Used for dialogue enhancement
character={characters.find(c => c.id === selectedElement.character_id)}
```

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Phase 2 - AI Chat Endpoint

**Location:** `app/api/scripts/[scriptId]/ai/chat/route.ts`

This endpoint is referenced by ScriptAIAssistantPanel but not yet created. To implement:

1. **Create Route Handler:**

```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest, { params }) {
  const { message, context, conversationHistory } = await request.json()

  // Use hybrid AI model (Claude for creative, GPT for structure)
  const response = await AIService.chat({
    messages: buildMessages(conversationHistory, message),
    context: buildScreenplayContext(context),
  })

  return NextResponse.json({ response: response.content })
}
```

2. **Screenplay-Specific System Prompt:**

```typescript
const systemPrompt = `
You are an expert screenplay writing assistant. You help with:
- Story structure (3-act, Save the Cat, Hero's Journey)
- Dialogue polish and character voice
- Scene pacing and beats
- Format adherence (industry standards)
- Character arcs and development

Current screenplay context:
- Type: ${context.scriptType}
- Genre: ${context.genre.join(', ')}
- Logline: ${context.logline}
- Current page: ${context.currentPage}/${context.totalPages}
`
```

### Phase 3 - Additional Features

- Coverage generation (synopsis, logline, character breakdowns)
- Beat generation (Save the Cat, Hero's Journey)
- Structure analysis (3-act, pacing issues)
- Character voice consistency check
- Format validation and auto-fix
