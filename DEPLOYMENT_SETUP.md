## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Step 1: Configure Stripe Webhook

You need to add a webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard to receive subscription events.

**Option A: Stripe Dashboard (Recommended)**

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click **"Add endpoint"**
3. Enter webhook URL:
   ```
   https://ottopen.app/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```
4. Select these events:
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - `account.updated`
5. Click **"Add endpoint"**
6. **Copy the webhook signing secret** (starts with `whsec_`)

**Option B: Stripe CLI (For Local Testing)**

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```
