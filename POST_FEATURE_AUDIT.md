## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

### **Issue 1: Missing Remove Image Button** (Medium Priority)

**Problem:** Once an image is selected, there's no way to remove it without uploading a different image.

**Impact:** Poor UX - users can't change their mind about including an image.

**Fix:** Add a remove/clear button when image preview is shown.

---

### **Issue 2: No Storage Policy Constraints** (High Priority)

**Problem:** Storage bucket has no file size limit or MIME type restrictions at database level.

**Current State:**

```
file_size_limit: null
allowed_mime_types: null
```

**Impact:** Users could potentially upload large files or non-image files via direct API calls.

**Fix:** Add storage bucket policies with 5MB limit and allowed MIME types.

---

### **Issue 3: Excerpt Button Does Nothing** (Low Priority)

**Problem:** The "Excerpt" button in the UI doesn't do anything - it's just decorative.

**Current Code:**

```tsx
<Button variant="ghost" size="sm" disabled={creatingPost}>
  <PenTool className="h-3 w-3 sm:h-4 sm:w-4 mr-1" />
  <span>Excerpt</span>
</Button>
```

**Impact:** Confusing UX - users might expect it to toggle excerpt field visibility.

**Fix:** Either remove the button or make it toggle excerpt textarea visibility.

---

### **Issue 4: No Character Limit Warning** (Low Priority)

**Problem:** No visual indication of recommended character limits for content.

**Impact:** Users might create overly long posts.

**Recommendation:** Add character counter with soft limit (e.g., 5000 characters).

---

### **Issue 5: Mood Labels Not User-Friendly** (Low Priority)

**Problem:** Mood value "seeking_feedback" uses underscore instead of space.

**Current:**

```tsx
<option value="seeking_feedback">Seeking Feedback</option>
```

**Impact:** Database stores "seeking_feedback" but displays "Seeking Feedback" inconsistently.

**Fix:** Display formatted mood in PostCard (convert underscores to spaces, capitalize).

---

### **Issue 6: No Image Upload Progress** (Medium Priority)

**Problem:** For large images (near 5MB), no progress indicator during upload.

**Impact:** User doesn't know if upload is progressing or stuck.

**Fix:** Add upload progress bar using Supabase upload progress callback.

---

### **Issue 7: Image Preview Not Cleared on Error** (Low Priority)

**Problem:** If image upload fails, preview remains but post submits without image.

**Impact:** User thinks image was uploaded when it wasn't.

**Fix:** Clear preview if upload fails, show clear error message.

---

### **Issue 8: No Draft Save Feature** (Enhancement)

**Problem:** If user navigates away, their post content is lost.

**Impact:** Poor UX for longer posts.

**Recommendation:** Auto-save draft to localStorage every 30 seconds.

## üìä Database Schema Analysis

### Posts Table

```sql
- id: uuid (PK)
- user_id: uuid (FK) ‚úÖ
- title: text (NOT NULL) ‚ö†Ô∏è Always empty string
- content: text (NOT NULL) ‚úÖ
- excerpt: text (nullable) ‚úÖ
- image_url: text (nullable) ‚úÖ
- mood: text (nullable) ‚úÖ
- published: boolean (default false) ‚úÖ
- created_at: timestamp ‚úÖ
- updated_at: timestamp ‚úÖ
```

**Issue:** `title` is required but always set to empty string. Consider making it nullable or using it.

---

## üîí Security Analysis

### ‚úÖ Good Security Practices

1. File type validation on client side
2. File size validation on client side
3. User authentication required
4. RLS policies on posts table

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Gaps

1. **No server-side file validation** - Could bypass client validation with API calls
2. **No rate limiting** - User could spam posts
3. **No content moderation** - No profanity filter or spam detection
4. **Storage bucket too permissive** - No policies on file size/type

---

## üéØ Recommended Improvements

### High Priority

1. ‚úÖ Add storage bucket size and MIME type limits
2. ‚úÖ Add remove image button
3. ‚úÖ Fix image upload error handling

### Medium Priority

4. ‚úÖ Add upload progress indicator
5. ‚úÖ Make excerpt button functional or remove it
6. ‚úÖ Add character counter

### Low Priority

7. Format mood display properly
8. Add draft auto-save
9. Consider using title field or removing requirement

### Future Enhancements

10. Add post scheduling
11. Add post edit functionality
12. Add rich text formatting
13. Add mentions (@username)
14. Add hashtags (#topic)
15. Add link previews

---

## üìà Performance Analysis

### Good

- ‚úÖ Lazy loading for images (`loading="lazy"`)
- ‚úÖ Optimized queries with posts_with_stats view
- ‚úÖ Client-side image preview (no server roundtrip)

### Could Improve

- Image optimization (resize before upload)
- Compress images on upload
- Add CDN for image delivery

---

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Manual Tests Needed

1. Upload 4.9MB image (should work)
2. Upload 5.1MB image (should fail with clear error)
3. Upload .gif file (should fail - not in allowed types)
4. Upload .svg file (should fail)
5. Create post with only excerpt, no content (should fail)
6. Create post with special characters / emojis
7. Create post with very long content (10,000+ chars)
8. Test image upload failure recovery

### Automated Tests Needed

1. Unit tests for file validation logic
2. Integration tests for post creation
3. E2E tests for full posting flow
