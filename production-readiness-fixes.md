# Production Readiness Fixes Applied

**Date**: October 11, 2025
**Status**: FIXES APPLIED - READY FOR TESTING

---

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. ‚úÖ Session Persistence Fix

**Issue**: Redirect loop after page reload causing users to be signed out
**Root Cause**: Middleware was using `getUser()` instead of `getSession()`, causing stale session detection
**Fix Applied**:

- Updated `middleware.ts` to use `getSession()` instead of `getUser()`
- This ensures session cookies are properly refreshed on each request
- Session state is now properly maintained across page reloads

**Files Modified**:

- `middleware.ts` (lines 76-82)

**Impact**: Users will now stay signed in across page reloads and navigation

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Avatar Button Selector Fix

**Issue**: Tests timing out waiting for avatar button, navigation menu inaccessible
**Root Cause**: Complex selector without test ID made button hard to find reliably
**Fix Applied**:

- Added `data-testid="user-avatar-button"` to avatar button in navigation
- Tests can now use reliable selector: `getByTestId('user-avatar-button')`

**Files Modified**:

- `src/components/navigation.tsx` (line 116)

**Impact**: More reliable UI testing and better test stability

INSERT INTO scripts (user_id, title, content, format, status)
SELECT
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'akangbou.emma@gmail.com'),
  'Test Screenplay',
  'INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY\n\nA writer sits alone, typing.',
  'screenplay',
  'draft'
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM scripts WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'akangbou.emma@gmail.com')
  LIMIT 1
);
```

   npm run test:e2e -- comprehensive-test.spec.ts
   ```

   Expected: Avatar button found, dropdown menu accessible

3. **API Tests**

   ```bash
   # Test subscription API
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/subscription-status

   # Test referral APIs
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/referrals/stats
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/referrals/earnings
   ```

4. **Manual Testing Checklist**
